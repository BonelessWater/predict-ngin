**Date:** February 2026  
**Focus:** Prediction Markets (Polymarket) Trading Research

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes current research on position sizing, execution quality, and strategy generation for prediction markets, with specific focus on Polymarket trading strategies.

---

## 1. Position Sizing Strategies

### 1.1 Kelly Criterion in Prediction Markets

**Key Finding:** Market prices in prediction markets do not normally match actual probabilities of events occurring. This gap between prices and probabilities is critical for proper position sizing.

**Research Insights:**
- Kelly Criterion maximizes capital growth rate through optimal position sizing
- Uses logarithmic utility and information theory
- **Critical distinction:** Market prices ≠ true probabilities in prediction markets
- Modified payout structures may be needed to reduce price-probability gaps
- Kullback-Leibler divergence measures impact of bias misjudgment

**Practical Application:**
- Use fractional Kelly (25-50% of full Kelly) to reduce volatility
- Adjust for the gap between market prices and subjective probability estimates
- Consider volatility-adjusted Kelly sizing for high-volatility markets

**Reference:** "Application of the Kelly Criterion to Prediction Markets" (arXiv:2412.14144)

### 1.2 Volatility-Adjusted Sizing

**Key Finding:** Optimal position size depends on specific asset price characteristics and market conditions, not standard frameworks.

**Research Insights:**
- Relative position sizing significantly impacts trading results
- Volatility characteristics vary by market type and conditions
- Standard sizing frameworks may not apply directly to prediction markets
- Need to account for bounded price ranges (0-1) in prediction markets

**Practical Application:**
- Scale positions inversely with volatility
- Target portfolio-level volatility (e.g., 15% annualized)
- Adjust for market-specific volatility patterns

**Reference:** "Managing Position Size Depending on Asset Price Characteristics" (SSRN:2913172)

### 1.3 Risk Parity Approaches

**Key Finding:** Risk parity allocates assets to equalize risk contribution rather than equal dollar weights.

**Research Insights:**
- Traditional portfolios (60/40) derive 90% risk from equities
- Risk parity equalizes risk contribution across positions
- Active risk budgeting improves upon standard risk parity
- "Outcome risk parity" extends to include return predictability

**Practical Application:**
- Allocate based on equal risk contribution, not equal capital
- Adjust for mean-reversion vs momentum characteristics
- Consider portfolio heat (total risk exposure) when sizing

**Reference:** "From Risk Parity to Outcome Risk Parity" (SSRN:4444069)

## 2. Execution Quality & Slippage

### 2.1 Market Impact Models

**Key Finding:** Market impact follows a 3/5 power law (not square-root) with coefficients depending on volatility, daily volume, and turnover.

**Research Insights:**
- Temporary impact: power law with 3/5 exponent
- Coefficients depend on:
  - Volatility
  - Daily volume
  - Turnover
- Long-term impact: correlated orders create cumulative costs
- Expected Future Flow Shortfall (EFFS) measures cumulative impact

**Practical Application:**
- Use power-law models (not just square-root) for impact estimation
- Account for volatility and volume in impact calculations
- Consider cumulative impact from correlated trades

**Reference:** "Quantifying Long-Term Market Impact" (SSRN:3874261)

### 2.2 Slippage Decomposition

**Key Finding:** Slippage = Market Impact + Market Risk

**Research Insights:**
- Market impact: price movement caused by the order itself
- Market risk: price movement from exogenous factors
- Understanding decomposition is essential for optimization
- RL frameworks can discover optimal execution strategies

**Practical Application:**
- Measure both components separately
- Optimize execution timing to minimize market risk
- Use execution algorithms that balance impact vs risk

**Reference:** Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Execution (arXiv)

### 2.3 Polymarket-Specific Execution Costs

**Key Finding:** Transaction fees are ~2% on profitable outcomes, significantly impacting profitability.

**Research Insights:**
- Account for ~2% transaction fees when calculating position sizes
- Fees significantly impact whether opportunities remain profitable
- Execution windows are often seconds-long
- Fragmented liquidity creates execution challenges

**Practical Application:**
- Factor 2% fees into all profitability calculations
- Optimize for quick execution (seconds, not minutes)
- Monitor liquidity fragmentation
- Use limit orders when possible to reduce slippage

## 3. Strategy Generation & Optimization

### 3.1 Genetic Programming for Strategy Generation

**Key Finding:** Genetic programming can automatically generate human-readable trading strategies.

**Research Insights:**
- Modular input/output systems decoupled from GP kernel
- NSGA-II multi-objective selection improves performance and interpretability
- Strategies can be optimized for both returns and risk
- Regularization prevents overfitting

**Practical Application:**
- Use GP to explore strategy space
- Optimize for multiple objectives (Sharpe, returns, drawdown)
- Regularize to prevent overfitting
- Generate interpretable strategies

**Reference:** "Generating and Optimizing Human-Readable Quantitative Program Trading Strategies" (ScienceDirect)

### 3.2 Meta Reinforcement Learning

**Key Finding:** Meta RL with cognitive game theory achieved 46.5-53.7% annualized returns with Sharpe ratios of 2.08-2.45.

**Research Insights:**
- Combines meta reinforcement learning with cognitive game theory
- Strong risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 2.08-2.45)
- Managed drawdowns (-10.2% to -12.1%)
- Works across global markets

**Practical Application:**
- Consider RL-based strategy optimization
- Incorporate game-theoretic elements
- Focus on risk-adjusted metrics, not just returns
- Test across multiple market regimes

**Reference:** "Adaptive Quantitative Trading Strategy Optimization Framework" (Springer)

### 3.3 Semantic Market Clustering

**Key Finding:** Agentic AI using LLMs can identify relationships between related contracts, achieving 20% average returns with 60-70% relationship prediction accuracy.

**Research Insights:**
- LLMs can cluster markets semantically
- Discover correlated/anti-correlated outcome pairs
- Trading strategies based on relationships show strong returns
- Week-long horizons work well for relationship-based strategies

**Practical Application:**
- Use NLP/semantic similarity to find related markets
- Trade divergences between related markets
- Monitor relationship strength over time
- Combine with price correlation analysis

**Reference:** "Semantic Trading: Agentic AI for Clustering and Relationship Discovery" (arXiv:2512.02436)

### 3.4 Backtest Overfitting Concerns

**Key Finding:** Backtest overfitting is a major concern - calibrating through historical simulation often leads to underperformance.

**Research Insights:**
- Multiple backtest configurations increase overfitting risk
- Optimal trading rules without multiple configurations may help
- Identifying non-overfit solutions remains an open problem
- Need robust validation frameworks

**Practical Application:**
- Use walk-forward validation
- Test on out-of-sample data
- Limit parameter optimization iterations
- Focus on robust strategies, not perfect fits

**Strategy Types:**

1. **Binary Market Arbitrage**
   - YES + NO prices should sum to $1.00
   - When they don't, buy both sides for guaranteed profit
   - Example: YES=$0.48, NO=$0.49 → Buy both for $0.97, profit $0.03 (3.09%)

2. **Multi-Outcome Arbitrage**
   - All outcome prices should sum to $1.00
   - Buy all outcomes when sum < $1.00
   - Lock in risk-free profits

3. **Cross-Platform Arbitrage**
   - Exploit price differences between Polymarket and Kalshi
   - Can yield 12.7% returns on capital

4. **Endgame Arbitrage**
   - Buy near-certain outcomes (95-99%) close to resolution
   - High annualized returns, lower per-trade margins

**Performance Data:**
- Profitable users: 0.51% of participants
- One trader: $10K → $100K over 6 months (10,000+ markets)
- Average margins: 2-3%
