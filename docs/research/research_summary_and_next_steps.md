# Research Summary & Next Steps

**Date:** February 2026  
**Research Focus:** Position Sizing, Execution, and Strategy Generation for Prediction Markets

## Research Conducted

### 1. Literature Review ✅
- Reviewed 15+ academic papers and industry sources
- Focused on prediction markets, Polymarket-specific strategies, and quantitative trading
- Key findings documented in `position_sizing_execution_literature_review.md`

### 2. Script Development ✅
- Created comprehensive research script: `scripts/research/position_sizing_execution_research.py`
- Implements 7 position sizing methods
- Tests execution quality metrics
- Includes checkpointing for long-running research

### 3. Key Research Findings

#### Position Sizing
- **Kelly Criterion** works but must account for price-probability gaps in prediction markets
- **Volatility-adjusted sizing** is critical (target 15% portfolio volatility)
- **Risk parity** equalizes risk contribution, not capital allocation
- **Fractional Kelly** (25-50%) reduces volatility while maintaining growth

#### Execution Quality
- **Market impact** follows 3/5 power law (not square-root)
- **Slippage** = Market Impact + Market Risk (decompose both)
- **Polymarket fees** are ~2% on profitable outcomes (critical for profitability)
- **Execution windows** are seconds-long (need fast systems)

#### Strategy Generation
- **Genetic programming** can auto-generate strategies
- **Meta RL** achieved 46-54% returns with Sharpe 2.08-2.45
- **Semantic clustering** finds related markets (20% returns, 60-70% accuracy)
- **Backtest overfitting** is a major concern (use walk-forward validation)

#### Polymarket-Specific
- **Arbitrage opportunities**: $40M+ extracted (April 2024-2025)
- **Binary arbitrage**: YES+NO should = $1.00
- **Cross-platform arbitrage**: 12.7% returns possible
- **Volatility capture**: 15%+ moves in 3 seconds

## Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 1: Enhance Research Script (1-2 hours)

1. **Add Power-Law Impact Model**
   ```python
   # Replace square-root with 3/5 power law
   impact = coefficient * volatility * (size / volume) ** (3/5)
   ```

2. **Implement Slippage Decomposition**
   ```python
   total_slippage = market_impact + market_risk
   # Measure both components separately
   ```

3. **Add Polymarket Fee Accounting**
   ```python
   # Account for 2% transaction fees
   net_pnl = gross_pnl * (1 - 0.02) - execution_costs
   ```

4. **Implement Probability-Price Gap Adjustment**
   ```python
   # Adjust Kelly sizing for price-probability gap
   adjusted_kelly = kelly * (subjective_prob / market_price)
   ```

### Phase 2: Add Strategy Variants (2-3 hours)

1. **Arbitrage Strategies**
   - Binary market arbitrage detection
   - Multi-outcome arbitrage
   - Cross-market price divergence

2. **Volatility Capture**
   - Monitor for 15%+ moves in 3 seconds
   - Automated trigger system
   - Hedging mechanisms

3. **Semantic Relationship Trading**
   - Use NLP similarity (already have script)
   - Trade divergences between related markets
   - Monitor relationship strength

### Phase 3: Validation Framework (1-2 hours)

1. **Walk-Forward Validation**
   - Rolling window testing
   - Out-of-sample validation
   - Multiple time periods

2. **Overfitting Detection**
   - Parameter stability checks
   - Performance degradation metrics
   - Robustness tests

3. **Risk Metrics**
   - Maximum drawdown tracking
   - Sharpe ratio consistency
   - Win rate stability

## Recommended Research Priorities

### High Priority (Do First)
1. ✅ **Literature review** - COMPLETE
2. ✅ **Basic research script** - COMPLETE
3. **Add Polymarket fee accounting** - CRITICAL (2% fees)
4. **Implement power-law impact model** - IMPORTANT (more accurate)
5. **Add slippage decomposition** - IMPORTANT (better analysis)

### Medium Priority (Do Next)
6. **Arbitrage strategy detection** - HIGH VALUE ($40M+ opportunity)
7. **Walk-forward validation** - PREVENTS OVERFITTING
8. **Semantic relationship trading** - COMPLEMENTS existing NLP work
9. **Volatility capture strategy** - HIGH RETURNS (if automated)

### Low Priority (Future)
10. **Genetic programming strategy generation** - COMPLEX
11. **Meta RL optimization** - RESEARCH-INTENSIVE
12. **Cross-platform arbitrage** - REQUIRES MULTIPLE APIS
